    <h2>My short life story</h2>
    <p>My name is Getahun Belay, I am Originally from Ethiopia. I have Three brothers
        and Four Sisters. I grow up in Bahir Dar, capital city of Amhara region, found
        in North-West part of Ethiopia. I have been attended elementary through high
        school in this town. And I have been attended my higher education in Alemaya
        University, currently named as Haromaya University and Addis Baba University.
        I awarded my bachelor degree in mathematics and M.Sc. Degree in Statistics.</p>

    <p> I am married in 2010 and I have two lovely daughters and one boy.
        I love spending more time with my family, specially with two daughters.
        Even though they have more love for their mom than me, they want horse
        play and going outside with me.</p>
